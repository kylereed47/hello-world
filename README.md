Hello World repository! THE FIRST
======================================



This is my first repository on github. Thanks to the hello-world guide found at: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/, I will be up to speed on how to use github.
This section is to learn about commits.
Forgot to mention this was created in the readme-edits branch.
